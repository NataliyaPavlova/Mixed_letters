- What it does: 
It mixes all letters (except the first and the last) in a word from the file and put new text to the new file.

- How to launch:
You should copy "text_mess.py" and "text.txt" to your computer.
Then you may print "python3 text_mess.py filename" in a console (or python, not python3, depends on your settings). 
Filename is a name of file contained a text you'd like to work with. The file should be in the same directory with "text_mess.py". 
If you don't provide a filename, the program uses 'text.txt' by default. 

- Requirements:
Python 3
